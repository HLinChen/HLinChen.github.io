I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://nus.edu.sg/), under the supervision of [Assoc Prof Lee Gim Hee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leegh/).
I received my B.Eng in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/) and 
[Faculty of Engineering](https://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin/ay202122/programmes/faculty-of-engineering/) at NUS in 2022, under the Science and Technology Scholarship. 

My research interests lie in the intersection between 3D computer vision and deep learning. I am particularly interested in reconstructing and understanding 3D dynamic scenes.
My aim is to create intelligent agents that can perceive, understand, plan and interact with the complex dynamic environment.
